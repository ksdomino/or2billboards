**Complete set of Original Billboard Files.**

Folders and files (in a zip file) for replacing the Billboards in Outrun 2 Pc

[Click here to go to the releases page](https://github.com/ksdomino/or2billboards/releases)

These can be used for creating your own custom billboards.
(like my [incomplete] retro 80's/90s set that I can now complete using this.). 

Notes: 
- hierarchical folder and filename text file included in the zip. 
- These are in their original folders so if you replace the files in the folders you'll have a full set optimised for minimising the ingame loading lag.

Here's a folder list too in case you want to create cool per-stage billboards based on the stage location:
